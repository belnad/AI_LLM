      "Summary: The article discusses how President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could increase the price of imported goods, including gaming consoles like the PlayStation 5 Pro. If implemented, these tariffs could raise the cost of video game consoles by 40% on average. The article analyzes different financing options for buying the PS5 Pro and suggests that using a credit card to finance the purchase can be costly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author argues that buying the console now with a credit card and making minimum monthly payments can lead to a lengthy debt cycle, taking over seven years to pay off, with more than double the extra cost from the price hikes. However, if the buyer makes consistent monthly payments towards the balance, they may be able to avoid paying excessive interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article concludes that using a credit card to finance the purchase is not recommended due to the high interest rates and risk of falling into debt.
